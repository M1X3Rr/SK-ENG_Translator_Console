# SK-ENG_Translator_Console

This is a console translator app, that currently translates only Slovak to English words, but I'm planning to implement two-way translation.
The app starts by initializing the Dictionary with 5 words; afterword, the user can choose to get the status of the dictionary (all the words or a number of words) or translate a Slovak word to English.
If the given word is not in the dictionary, the user may add it, if they wish to.

P.S.: I added Thread freezing for random periods of time when starting the app and canceling to simulate the loading process, it is purely visual.
